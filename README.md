# OSX Dotfiles
After 3 years on OSX these dotfiles
provide me a little comfort and
workflow optimization. Some other items
are a bit experimental.

## Ansible
This is also a repo created as an experiment
to test the [dotfiles Ansible role](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-dotfiles)
from Geerlingguy along with the more
full-featured [Ansible Macbook environment](https://github.com/smbambling/ansible-macbook-environment)
set up process I've been working on with Bambling
